Help improve our software! We welcome contributions from everyone, whether to add new features, improve speed, fix existing bugs or add support. [Check our code of conduct](code-of-conduct.md), [the contributing guidelines](contributing.md) and how decisions are made.

Any code contributions are welcomed as long as they are discussed in [Github Issues](https://github.com/RentadroneCL/Web-API/issues) with maintainers. Be aware that if you decide to change something and submit a PR on your own, it may not be accepted.

## Contributing

We use a combination of GitFlow and Forking Workflow.

### Steps

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a branch depending on the issue that you are working on. See branch reference list bellow.
3. Do your work and commit.
4. Create a Pull Request to the development branch.

### Branch reference list

* `feature/{name}` - New functionality or refactoring.
* `bugfix/{name}` - Fixes existing code.
* `hotfix/{name}` - Urgent production fix.
* `support/{name}` - Documentation updates.

Replace `{name}` with the name that best describes what your PR is about.

## Creating an issue

To encourage active collaboration, we strongly encourages pull requests, not just bug reports. "Bug reports" may also be sent in the form of a pull request containing a failing test.

However, if you file a bug report, your issue should contain a title and a clear description of the issue. You should also include as much relevant information as possible and a code sample that demonstrates the issue. The goal of a bug report is to make it easy for yourself - and others - to replicate the bug and develop a fix.

Remember, bug reports are created in the hope that others with the same problem will be able to collaborate with you on solving it. Do not expect that the bug report will automatically see any activity or that others will jump to fix it. Creating a bug report serves to help yourself and others start on the path of fixing the problem. If you want to chip in, you can help out by fixing any bugs listed in our [issue trackers](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.15/user/articles/creating-an-issue).
