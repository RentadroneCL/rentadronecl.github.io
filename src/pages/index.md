Establishing an inclusive community of AI researchers to facilitate the development and exchange of best practices for the implementation of AI in thermographic and geoprocessing imaging.

## Our Vision

In an open-source world, collaboration and innovation are unbounded. Communities of passionate individuals come together to build and improve upon software, tools, and technology that anyone can use and contribute to. An open-source perspective envisions a world where access to technology is not limited by financial barriers, where knowledge is shared freely, and where anyone can participate in the creation and development of technology. With open-source, we can build a future where innovation is driven by the collective creativity and ingenuity of diverse and inclusive communities, leading to a better, more equitable world for all.

## Our Mission

Our mission is to create positive change by harnessing the power of technology and innovation. We strive to develop solutions that address societal challenges, promote inclusivity and diversity, and drive sustainable growth. We are committed to making a difference through open collaboration, transparency, and accountability. Our goal is to empower individuals and communities to leverage technology for their benefit, and to create a more equitable and sustainable world. We believe that by working together, we can achieve great things and make a lasting impact on our society and the world around us.

## Our Community

To foster a successful community-driven open-source perspective, it is essential to prioritize inclusivity, transparency, and collaboration. A successful open-source community welcomes diverse perspectives, encourages respectful discourse, and values contributions from all members, regardless of their background or level of experience. Open communication channels, transparent decision-making processes, and clear contribution guidelines are crucial to ensuring that everyone feels empowered to participate and contribute.

Additionally, it is essential to establish a clear governance structure that promotes accountability and fairness. The community should be guided by a set of shared values and principles, which should be reflected in the code of conduct and the project's roadmap. By creating a supportive and respectful environment that values the contributions of all members, the community can ensure the sustainability and growth of the project.

Finally, it is crucial to maintain a user-centric approach, where the needs and priorities of the community are at the forefront of all decision-making. Regular engagement with the community, collecting feedback and ideas, and prioritizing features and improvements that benefit the user base are vital to ensure the relevance and success of the project. With these guiding principles, an open-source community can build impactful and sustainable solutions that empower individuals and communities worldwide.

## Leadership and Governance

In an open-source context, leadership and governance refer to the processes and structures that guide the project's direction, decision-making, and community engagement. Effective leadership and governance are critical to ensuring that an open-source project remains relevant, sustainable, and successful in the long term.

Leadership in an open-source context is about empowering and enabling contributors to take ownership of the project's development and direction. Leaders should create an inclusive and collaborative culture that encourages participation and values diverse perspectives. They should also provide clear guidance and direction for the project while remaining open to feedback and change.

Governance in an open-source context involves establishing a decision-making framework that ensures fairness, transparency, and accountability. Governance structures can take various forms, from informal guidelines to formalized voting processes. The governance model should be designed to balance the needs of the project with the needs of the community, ensuring that decisions align with the project's mission and values.

Overall, effective leadership and governance in an open-source project are about creating an environment of trust, collaboration, and shared responsibility. By fostering a culture of openness, inclusivity, and accountability, open-source projects can thrive and make a meaningful impact on the world.
